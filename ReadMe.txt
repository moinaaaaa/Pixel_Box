Thanks for downloading Pixelbox!

Pixelbox is a front end program that uses other Emulators to give the user a friendly and easy to understand experience.

i aimed to use Freeware and Opensource Emulation, Should the devolper of any of These Emulators be unhappy with his Emulator being used in this frontend, they can contact me on Itch.io

I do not endorse Piracy in any way or form, should you use an illegally aquired Rom, the responsability is yours.

Now, to use Pixelbox; Simply Put your legally acquired roms in their respective Folder, i.e "super_cool_gba_game.gba" would go in root./roms/gba.
You can Change the Backgrounds as you like, just Keep in mind they Need to be 800x600 in order to fit, and they also recquire their Name to be exact.

Again, as an example; if you make a cool drawing of a gba, the filename would Need to be temporary_gba_bg.png

All of the art for this program has been made using GIMP.

in case his wasnt clear enough:
move through Systems with the arrow keys, klick with your mosue to choose a rom
